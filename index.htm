font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>How I Began My Research, and What I Found </span></b><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br>
I first became interested in our family history when I was a teenager. My
mother’s family was of German descent—we all knew that—but no one could tell me
for sure where and when the Brown family came to the United States. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There was also a story passed on to me by
my grandfather, Paul Marquis Brown (whom I never knew), and others, that his
mother, Marie Elvira Shuck, was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian. This story
sparked my interest, and I wanted to find out whether or not it was true.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Off and on over the years I worked on the
Brown family genealogy and acquired many valuable and useful documents. My
intent here is to pass on some of the information I have collected so it will
not be lost to any other Brown family researcher. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This report is limited mostly to the
people noted in the Brown Family Bible. I have not included my own family or my
generation, only information about the early Brown families. I digitized copies
of the original documents I found, both to preserve them and to make them easy
to share and pass on to others. Click on a document link, read it for yourself,
and make your own conclusions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The Brown Family Bible was first in the
custody of my granduncle, William Brown (son of F.H.T. Brown), who lived in New
Mexico. William gave the Bible to his cousin, Luther Shuck, who then passed it
on to my uncle Marquis. Marquis eventually passed the bible on to his own son,
my cousin, Charles Brown. My research started when Charles made copies of the
family history pages from the bible and sent them to me. (<i>Note: Some of
these handwritten pages are hard to read. See page 3 of this document for typed
versions of this information.</i>)<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>William Brown’s letter to Marquis Brown
gives information about William’s father, Francis Hendren Taylor Brown, who is
generally referred to as F.H.T. Brown. William states that his father (F.H.T.
Brown) was in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy from March 1862 to
the end of the War in 1865. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2018 I found the obituary of Captain
James C. Marquis on the <i>Find a Grave’s</i> website. He is the same Captain
Marquis my great-grandfather (Frances Hendren Taylor Brown) served under in the
Civil War. Captain Marquis’s obituary gives great credence to my great-uncle
Edward Brown’s letter to my uncle Mark. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Captain Marquis’s obituary shows that my
great-grandfather, F.H.T. Brown, served in the Civil War as a young boy (as the
letter states), but not officially because of his young age. F.H.T. Brown
officially joined the Confederacy in May 28, 1864, a few days after his 17th
birthday, on May 12, 1864. See:<br>

James C. Marquis</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The story my father told me was that
F.H.T. Brown liked his captain so much that the middle name of his (F.H.T.’s)
son, Paul Marquis Brown, came from the captain’s name. Paul Marquis Brown then named
one of his sons Marquis Anthony Brown and his daughter Dorothy Marquis Brown.
My parents then named me after my uncle Marquis, who was called Mark. The name
continues in the Brown family with my cousin Charles Brown naming his son
Marquis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>William Brown also talks about his
grandfather, John Joseph Decature Brown (F.H.T. Brown’s father), being the
supervising architect of the Buckhorn tavern in Staunton, Virginia. The tavern
is still in operation, and I’ve included a flyer from the 1990s in these documents.
See:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>William’s letter ends with “…don’t give
the boys any rotten meat like they got in 1898.” I found this information about
the 1898 rotten meat on the Internet: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“During the Spanish-American War (1898­-1901),
Armour Packing Company sold 500,000 pounds of beef to the US Army. An army
inspector tested the meat two months later and found that 751 cases contained
rotten meat. This resulted in the food poisoning of thousands of soldiers.”</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then there is the letter from William
Brown to Luther Shuck. In that letter, William Brown gives the Family Bible to
his cousin, Luther Shuck, saying that it should only be given to a male member
of the Brown family. That way, it would stay in the Brown family. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When I first received copies of the Brown
Family Bible, I found them confusing and hard to read, so I had a professional
genealogist arrange the information in a more understandable format. This gave
me a place to start my own research. See:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

back to the 1700s, I decided to check the accuracy of the information. I sent
away to the Virginia State Archives for the 1804 marriage records of Joseph
Brown and Mary Ritchey (Richey). The information was correct. See:<br>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since the marriage
of Joseph Brown and Mary Ritchey took place in Staunton, Virginia, I contacted
Donna Huffer, a local genealogical researcher, to help me find information
about the Browns in Virginia. Her research gave me a clue where Joseph Brown’s
family came from before they were in Staunton. Donna found a document that
referred to a lawsuit Mary Ritchey Brown’s husband, Joseph Brown, had against a
John Munn in Nottingham Township, Pennsylvania, for rents due. Also included in
the 1992 research document is information about the deaths of J.D. Brown’s two
young daughters from scarlet fever. See:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you look at the documents, you may
wonder why the TwentyGon property is under a Virginia Certificate when the
property is in Pennsylvania. At the time, both states claimed the territory.
Ultimately, Pennsylvania accepted the Virginia warrants and the property became
part of Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Along with the documents, let me give you
an overview of what the documents say. The Brown Family Bible lists the first
Brown as Joseph (ca. 1782-1809), saying only that he was born in Pennsylvania
and raised in Kentucky. From the documents I’ve researched, I’ve found that
Joseph Brown’s father was John Brown, Sr. (d. abt. 1786).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>John Brown Sr. and William Brown
(relationship unknown) apparently bought the TwentyGon property together, but
the property was only put in William’s name. John Brown Sr. married Rhoda, and
they had three children: John Jr., Joseph, and Anne. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>John Brown Sr. died before 1786, and a man
named David Hopkins was the Administrator of his will. Hopkins families lived
near the Twenty Gon. After John Sr. died, William sold half the Twenty Gon
property to John Sr.’s children (John Jr., Joseph, and Anne) to divide among
themselves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For some reason, William and his wife
Patience raised John Sr. and Rhoda's children for about two years before 1786.
Rhoda and David Hopkins later married, and the children moved to Kentucky with
them in 1792. Even though their mother was still alive, records found by
researcher G.J. Gregord speak of orphan court for Joseph, John, and Anne Brown.
In those days, children were considered orphans if they were fatherless. See:<br>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Reimbursements for
Wm Brown 1786</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then, in 1816, Rhoda Brown Hopkins came
back to Washington County, Pennsylvania, from Fleming, Kentucky, and sold her
widow’s share of one-third of the TwentyGon to her son, John Brown, Jr.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>With the children receiving half the
property, and their mother owning a third, that left one-sixth of the property
to William Brown. William may have been either the father or brother of John
Brown, Sr. (or maybe not).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You will see from these documents that
A.D. Hiller from the Bureau of Pensions in Washington, D.C., wrote back to a
woman named Eleanor Russell, who requested information about David Hopkins in
1934. (This used to be a service that was provided for people researching their
genealogy.) From these letters you can see that he is the same David Hopkins
that married Rhoda Brown, my fourth great-grandmother. If anyone in our Brown
family is interested in joining organizations such as the Sons or Daughters of
the American Revolution, this information should be sufficient to qualify you
for membership. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>(Note: I have more on David Hopkins’s war
service, but have not included it here because it doesn’t offer much specific
information. If anyone is interested in obtaining this information, however,
contact me or the National Archives Records Administration. David Hopkins’s
records can be found by first looking at “Abstracts of Revolutionary War
Pension Files,” under Hopkins, page 1702. See:<br>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Our David Hopkins is the second David
down, #S13307. This information will tell archivists where to find his records.
I also looked for John Brown and William Brown in the pension records, but was
not able to find any matches. They both could have fought in the American
Revolution, but John died before there were pensions, and the same may have
happened with William. Little is known about their backgrounds, so it’s
difficult to tell one John or William Brown in Revolutionary War records from
another.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So where did the Browns originally come
from? Records concerning our family in America that might have been created
earlier than those in this document probably do not exist—or at least I have
not been able to find them. Recordkeeping in the early 1700s was minimal, and
records were often destroyed by fires because there were so many wooden buildings.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Local genealogists and historians identify
the people who settled in early Western Pennsylvania as “Scotch Irish.” In
Europe, they were called “Ulster Irish”—people who, with the encouragement of
King James I, migrated to Northern Ireland in the early 1600s. Then, in the 1700s,
thousands of these Ulster Irish migrated to America from Northern Ireland. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Not all Ulster Irish who came to America were
originally from Scotland. During that same time period, people from England,
France, Germany, and other European countries had migrated to Northern Ireland
in an effort to escape religious persecution, and then came to America. As a
result, it is possible that our relatives in Western Pennsylvania were not
Scottish. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I won’t go into the general history here
because there are many books written on the subject, and much information about
the Scotch Irish is available on the Internet. However, there is one excerpt
from Wikipedia that explains how our relatives may have come to Western
Pennsylvania and then found their way to Staunton, Virginia: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Most Scotch-Irish headed for
Pennsylvania, with its good lands, moderate climate, and liberal laws. By 1750,
the Scotch-Irish were about a fourth of the population, rising to about a third
by the 1770s. Without much cash, they moved to free lands on the frontier,
becoming the typical western ‘squatters,’ the frontier guard of the colony, and

described as ‘the cutting-edge of the frontier.’</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“The Scotch-Irish moved up the Delaware
River to Bucks County, and then up the Susquehanna and Cumberland valleys,
finding flat lands along the rivers and creeks to set up their log cabins,
their grist mills, and their Presbyterian churches. Chester, Lancaster, and
Dauphin counties became their strongholds, and they built towns such as
Chambersburg, Gettysburg, Carlisle, and York; the next generation moved into
western Pennsylvania. With large numbers of children who needed their own

and Quakers and moved south, down the </span></i><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Around 2008, I took a DNA test for the
National Geographic Society’s “Genographic Project.” It used DNA to track human
migration from 60,000 years ago to about 1,000 years ago. The test showed that
our Brown male line goes back to Cro-Magnon people—the first to migrate into
Europe. They are also the same people who made the famous cave paintings in
Lascaux, France. According to the Genographic Project, our male line has DNA
markers in common with people who now live in northern Spain, England,
Scotland, and Ireland.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2018, I took DNA tests from 23andMe and
Ancestry.com. These tests found hundreds of people related to me, primarily in
the United States and Europe. Hopefully, now I will find where the our Brown
family originally came from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As for the other stories I’d heard about
my family, the story of my Cherokee great-grandmother, Marie Elvira Shuck (b.
1852; wife of F.H.T. Brown), seemed amazing to me. I researched the Shucks and
found nothing about them in the census records that suggested they could be
Native Americans. The census records always listed the Shucks as white, but
when I spoke to people at the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, I was told that
Cherokee people back then often listed themselves as white, when they could, to
avoid discrimination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My research went on for a long time. I
looked at every Cherokee census I could find at the National Archives and found
no matches. I even found a Cherokee woman named Shuck and studied her family
and found no connections. In our family, Harvey J. Brown was born “on the
Cherokee Nation” on August 29, 1888. That seemed to be a clue, but nothing else
even vaguely suggested that the Shucks were Cherokee. I was starting to think I
would never be able to prove (or disprove) that the Browns were part Cherokee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Then one day, while searching databases
online for John T. Shuck (the father of our alleged Indian, Marie Elvira
Shuck), I found his family in a book called <i>Genealogies of Virginia Families</i>.
Amazingly, there was the whole correct Shuck family, but with no Cherokees. On
page 434 of the book, however, I noticed the name of Elvira Barbara Madison
Hill, who was the mother of my great-grandmother, Marie Elvira Shuck. I also
noticed the familiar names of Elvira’s parents, who turned out to be the same
parents of my great-great-grandmother, Juliet Amanda Hill. That meant Juliet
Amanda Hill, mother of F.H.T. Brown, was the sister of Elvira Barbara Madison
Hill. So the Cherokee story was apparently made up to cover the fact that
F.H.T. Brown and his wife, Marie Elvira Shuck, were first cousins. See:<br>

font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You may notice a Catharine Burch (sometimes
Birch) living in the Brown household in the 1850, 1875, and 1880 census
records. Catharine is a bit of a mystery. I have never found who she was or her
relationship to the family. I’m guessing that she came from Amherst County,
Virginia, probably with Juliet Amanda Hill. I say that because Catharine is
listed as a witness to Hill family land records. The 1880 census lists her as
“Hurt by a cow, is helpless”; John Joseph Decature Brown lists her in his will
to make sure she is cared for. In the 1875 Kansas state census, there’s a J.W.
Burch that pops up, too. However, this is probably Joseph William Brown, born
in 1854. See: <br>

font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’ve included several Brown family census
records you might find interesting, including a John, Anne, and William Brown
in Waynsboro, Virginia (near Staunton), who may be the Browns that were
originally from Pennsylvania. Note that I only list one record before 1850.
That’s because census records before that year list only the head of household
by name, so it’s hard to evaluate the information or tell the specific people
living there. It was not until 1850 that everyone in the household was listed
by name in the census.<br>
<br>
The United State has taken a federal census every 10 years since 1790, but the
records aren’t released to the public until 72 years later. That means, for
instance, that the 1940 census won’t be released until 2012. Many census
records were lost over the years, so there are often gaps in the record: the
1890 census, for instance, was destroyed by fire, and I could not find evidence
of the Browns in the 1870 census records. (Records from that period are often
unreliable and incomplete; there were still Union troops in the South, and the
people did not want to cooperate.) See:<br>

with J.J.D. Brown and Juliet Amanda Hill Brown. The first census I can find
that shows her relationship to the head of household is the 1880 census which
lists Catherine as a friend to F.H.T. Brown. This census lists Catherine as
being crippled and unable to read or write, with the notation, “Hurt by a cow,
is helpless.” It lists her parents as being from Maryland; other than that,
nothing is known. Catherine probably lived with the Hill family and then with
the Browns after Juliet Amanda Hill married John Joseph Decature Brown.
Catherine is listed in J.J.D. Brown’s will. Oddly, another Burch, J.W., pops up
in the household in the 1875 Kansas state census, but this is probably Joseph

OBIT: Mrs. Julia Amanda Brown, aged 93, died at the home of her son, J.W.
Brown, at Haverhill this morning at 11:14. No time has been set for the
funeral, awaiting word from her son at Washington DC. Augusta Gazette Feb 9
1914<br>
<br>
OBIT: Mrs. Julia Amanda Brown of Haverhill, 91, mother of ex-Representative
Joseph Brown, of Haverhill, one of the most notable of Butler County's
pioneers, died Monday evening, Feb. 9. She had suffered several months from the
effects of a fall in which her right hip was broken. Many Eldorado people knew
Mrs. Brown. During the closing days of James Monroe's first presidential term,
Juliet Amanda Hill was born within the shadows of the historic Blue Ridge
mountains in Amherst County, Virginia, February 16, 1821. Her father William
Davis Hill, died when Juliet was 9 years old. He left his family in comfortable
circumstances, hence Juliet could continue her school work. It was four miles
to the school house from the hills. Juliet trudged these four miles each day.
In 1838 young Miss Hill went over to Augusta, Butler County, to teach school
near her brother's home farm. She taught there eight years and then married
Joseph Decatur Brown of Jennings Gap, VA. Of the six children born to Mr. and
Mrs. Brown, three boys survived the father. Like many other patriotic
southerners, Mrs. Brown had invested the residue of her father's fortune in Confederate
bonds. With the collapse of the Confederacy her fortune vanished. Bravely she
turned back to her old profession of teaching. She taught in Jennings Gap until
1871, when she struck out with her three sons for Kansas. They detrained at
Kansas City and began the overland journey to their future home in Spring
Township, Butler County, with a yoke of oxen, one prairie schooner, two cows,
one pig and a dozen chickens. The household goods had to be hauled through by
wagon freighters from Kansas City. Mrs. Brown filed on an 80-acre tract in the
Little Walnut River valley in Spring township. The three brothers rented land
adjoining. Times were very hard. Mrs. Brown again turned to teaching to keep
things going. In the spring of 1872 they planted their first crop of corn. It
was a good year, and they got a bumper crop. But in 1874 the grasshoppers
devoured everything in sight and left the new settlers almost on poverty row.
Relief agencies were established in the various school centers of the county
where clothing, flour, beans, meal, and bacon from the East were distributed to
the needy settlers. But the Browns did not ask for aid and Mrs. Brown stuck to
her teaching. Several times the boys got thoroughly discouraged and wanted to
give up the fight and move out. But each time this staunch pioneer encouraged
them with the words, &quot;Be still and see the Salvation of God&quot;. She was
right. They began to prosper. The oldest boy is a well to do farmer. The second
served with distinction as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal church, South.
The third is one of the richest men in Spring township today and has served his
district as a member of the legislature - Eldorado Republican. The funeral will
be held Thursday February 12th, at 2:30pm from the Christian church at Haverhill.

OBIT: Mrs. Juliet Brown, 93, is dead at Haverhill. Mrs. Juliet Brown, 93, died
Monday at Haverhill, after a two weeks illness from pneumonia. Juliet Hill was
born February 16, 1821, in Virginia. She married Joseph Brown in Virginia. She
came to Kansas in 1871 and settled in Spring township. Mrs. Brown had been
living for a year at home of her son, Joseph Brown, of Haverhill. Two other
sons survive. Walnut Valley Times Feb 13 1914 p. 1<br>
<br>
OBIT: Aged Woman dies. Mrs. E.B.M Shuck aged 90 years passed away at the home
of her daughter, Mrs. F.H.T. Brown about noon Friday after a lingering illness
of several months. The funeral will be held at the Johnstown Holiness church at
11 o'clock today, conducted by Rev. R. F. Morris and interment will be made in
the Carterville Cemetery. Mrs. Shuck was born in Amherst Co, VA in 1815. She
was therefore 90 years old at the time of her death. She has made her home with
her daughter since the death of her husband two years ago, previous to which
time she lived in Leon, Kan.<br>
<br>
OBIT: A. G. A. HILL had obituary in The Lynchburg Daily Virginian for 12
January 1861 on page 3, column 2. It says A. G. A. HILL, formerly of Amherst,
Va died in Lebanon, Missouri, after a long illness at age 43. It does not give
the date of his death.<br>
<br>
ARTICLE: Mr. Richard I [John]. Hill, formerly of this county, was murdered in
the village of Fallmanton, in Effingham county, Illinois, on the 14th of April
[1842], under most singular and shocking circumstances. It appears as he rode
in the village, some one who saw him approaching remarked &quot;there will be a
difficulty,&quot;--two individuals who were named, (with whom Mr. Hill had
probably some misunderstanding.) being in the village. Mr. Hill rode up and
shook hands with the gentleman to whom&nbsp;the foregoing remark was made,
while the one who made it passed into a neighboring black- smith shop. About
this time a gun was fired, and Mr. Hill fell from his horse, and expired in
about fifteen minutes, without speaking! Most strange to say--and certainly it
tells badly for the justice of the country--notwithstanding these
circumstances, and the open manner in which the murder was committed, the
investigation of the case failed to fix the bloody and cowardly deed on any
one. Mr. Hill was a married man, and we believe has left a family of children.</i></span></p>

William was living in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in 1943, when my uncle, Marquis
Anthony Brown, apparently wrote him concerning Brown family information. (See

William Brown refers to my uncle as Marquis Brown Jr. He was not a junior. His
mother, brother, and sister always called him Mark; I never heard anyone call
him Marquis.</span></p>

Family Bible in 1977 when I was in St. Louis for my father’s funeral. As I
recall, the bible itself had been published in 1890. I'll guess it was William
Brown’s confirmation bible, since his father was a clergyman and William would
have been 13 in 1890. Charles Brown made copies of the Family Bible for me,
which is how I began my research. –M.D.B.</span></p>
